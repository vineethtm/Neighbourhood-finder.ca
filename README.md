## Insight Project

This is a three-week project I did as a Data Science Fellow at Insight Toronto.

### Introduction
Market segmentation is the process of dividing the market into few groups based on features. One segement could be more important for a business than the others. While many large business correctly identify their market segments and target them, it is not obvious for new a new entrepreneur who the customers are. Many new businesses fail due to lack of correct market segmentation.
